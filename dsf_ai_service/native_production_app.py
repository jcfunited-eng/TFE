"""HTTP and observation transport for one native resident Guala organism.

The process restores only the raw binary ``CURRENT`` authority.  When the
state directory carries no organism body it performs one seeded growth-DNA
genesis whose anatomy episode declares this app's own sensory port roster and
persists the newborn body exactly as ordinary restore expects it.  It never
imports the retired Python Guala engine, generation stores, owner registries,
or cognition databases.  HTTP, observation projection, and static media remain
outside cognition.

Mounted native intake is limited to the admitted transitions below; every
other sense and actuator keeps its honest ``not_mounted`` refusal:

- ``POST /api/v1/curriculum/invite-card`` first moves the participant body in
  Guala's persistent world.  ``POST /api/v1/curriculum/teach-card`` can then
  deliver one matching approved card only when that exact approach's retinal
  perturbation produced a later directed neuronal continuation.  The card's
  letter or number identity remains transport metadata outside the organism;
  only the physical surface, pressure, contact, chemistry, and body samples
  are delivered.
- ``POST /api/v1/curriculum/invite-song`` uses the same physical participant
  and native-attention gate. ``POST /api/v1/curriculum/teach-song`` then
  presents one matching signed song as synchronized retinal light, cochlear
  pressure, and lawful body state on one shared clock. The alphabet song
  claims only its simultaneous 26-surface set; counting-song surface changes
  use the manifest's exact PCM sample intervals.
- ``POST /api/v1/visual/live-frames`` (and the legacy ``/sight_frame``
  mount point) delivers batches of real browser camera frames as admitted
  native episodes: one frame per 250 ms hop on the same 27-receptor
  retinal roster the cards use (Pillow BOX area-averaged luminance), with
  true 0.0 silence at both ears (a lawful state; audio is never
  fabricated) and honest caller-declared live-camera provenance.
- ``POST /api/v1/sensory/audiovisual`` accepts an AUTHORIZED cochlear roster's
  live microphone pressure only alongside co-captured live camera frames.
  Each frame pairs with exactly one 250 ms PCM hop in the same native
  whole-sensorium occurrence; neither signal is interpolated or invented.
  The older ``/sound_frame`` and mono ``/api/v1/auditory/pcm`` route names
  remain honest refusals and retain no sessions. A prior camera receipt is
  bookkeeping, not present light, and can never unlock audio-only intake.
- UNATTENDED TIME (autonomy increment 1, 2026-08-06): when no external
  intake is in flight, a background loop grants the organism genuinely
  dark, silent, unattended intervals — the same lawful construction as a
  lesson's ended hops (full sensorium, true dark exact optical occurrence,
  true silence, authored admission).  The passage of time is the medium,
  never a cause: the interval carries no stimulus, no score, and no
  injected activity; whatever happens in it is entirely the organism's own
  retained state (rest recovery reactions, membrane return, ledger drains,
  retained-state settling — or genuine quiescence, reported as rest).

Public observation is one cached, read-only projection per persisted native
generation.  Repeated reads do not call or advance the organism.  Every
accepted admitted intake (one lesson of hop transitions) commits its hops on
the in-process organism, persists and publishes the successor body exactly
once after its final hop, and only then refreshes this cache; readiness is
served under the same lock, so no surface ever reports unpersisted state.

# (no head geometry is declared, so no interaural difference is claimed), and
# each ear is a COCHLEA: sixteen tonotopic receptor sites, one per
# equivalent-rectangular-bandwidth place of the basilar membrane's travelling
# wave.  This is a birth anatomy, not a refinement:
#
#   * Participation retention (ratified 2026-08-05) retains an original only
#     when at least THREE changed members are connected through contacts that
#     were physically active.  Two ear ports can never satisfy it, so an ear
#     built from two ports would hear, burn fuel, and remember nothing forever.
#   * Each cochlear site is a DISTINCT declared place `(sense_layer,
#     topology_index)`, so the ratified Cantor territory law
#     (`declared_geometric_anatomy`) gives every one of them a distinct
#     membrane capacitance.  Identical anatomy makes stored energy tie exactly
#     and the energy-descent transfer law refuses ties: identical ear ports are
#     a permanent Coulomb blockade.  Distinctness here is authored geometry,
#     not a differentiation scheme bolted on top.
#
# AUTHORIZATION GATE (2026-08-06).  Widening the declared ear roster is what
# makes a cochlear cohort GROW onto the body the next time sound reaches it.
# Growing a sense organ onto a living organism is a DELIBERATE ACT and must
# never be a side effect of shipping an image, so the widened roster is behind
# an explicit opt-in that no deploy sets.  The env-var precedent is this app's
# own ``GUALA_UNATTENDED_TIME``, inverted: unattended time defaults ON because
# it changes nothing structural, cochlear ears default OFF because they do.
#
# DEFAULT OFF is byte-exactly the roster the living organism receives today:
# two co-located ear pressure ports, the legacy declared quantity, one

# the touched object's footprint covers ITS OWN declared patch.  Two things
# about that sheet have to be authored, and BOTH are read off anatomy this
# organism already declares rather than picked:
#
#   * ITS GEOMETRY IS HER OWN DECLARED SENSORY-SHEET GEOMETRY.  This body
#     declares exactly one sheet of receptor places — 3 rows by 9 columns — and
#     the contact sheet reuses it VERBATIM.  Nothing is selected, combined,
#     maximized or rounded: the two integers are the two integers already in
#     the tree.  (A square sheet was considered and rejected: it needs
#     max(3, 9), which is a choice, and it was independently falsified by
#     measurement — a 9x9 sheet is 81 sites, and 27 sight + 34 ear + 81 touch
#     ports at 250 retained instants is 35,500 samples, over the transport's
#     own MAX_NATIVE_SAMPLES_PER_SETTLEMENT of 32,768.  It also reports NO
#     out-of-contact site for any approved card, so "nothing outside the card"
#     — the one thing touch most honestly knows — would never be said.)
#   * ITS SITES ARE UNIT PATCHES.  The ratified Cantor territory law
#     (declared_geometric_anatomy) already measures membrane in "unit patches"
#     and declares no aspect for one, so a contact site is isotropic and the
#     sheet is 9 patches wide by 3 patches tall.  A non-square site would be an
#     aspect claim that is nowhere in the tree.
#
# Each contact site is a DISTINCT declared place `(sense_layer, topology_index)`
# in a sense layer — Touch, layer 2 — that this body has never used, so the
# ratified Cantor territory law gives every one of them a distinct membrane
# capacitance.  Identical anatomy makes stored energy tie exactly and the
# energy-descent transfer law refuses ties: identical receptors are a permanent
# Coulomb blockade.  That lesson was paid for on the ears and is not re-learned
# here.
#
# GROWTH, NOT REBIRTH.  Layer 2 holds none of her body's existing places, and
# the contact ports are appended AFTER every port currently declared, so a

# INTEROCEPTION — the sense of her own inside (2026-08-07).
#
# BIOLOGICAL COUNTERPART (the rule, Joe 2026-08-07): interoceptors — the
# chemoreceptors and baroreceptors that report an animal's internal milieu to
# itself.  Hunger, warmth and effort are not thoughts about the body; they are
# receptors transducing real quantities OF the body.  Every animal with a
# metabolism has them, and they are the oldest sense there is.
#
# WHY THIS ONE IS NOT A COSTUME, unlike anything that would have to be
# invented for smell or balance today: it transduces quantities her body
# ALREADY HAS and already reports as decoded native state — the recovery-fuel
# reservoir, the heat and spent ledgers, the separated membrane charge, the
# dissipation it could not meet.  Nothing is authored, nothing is declared by
# a caller, nothing is measured from a file.  Cut the receptors and the
# numbers still exist; she simply stops being able to feel them.
#
# GROWTH RATE, stated before building it (the rule): FIVE receptor sites, one
# per interoceptive channel below.  Five substreams per hop and ONE additional
# occurrence per hop — the same order as one cochlea, far less than the
# 27-site contact sheet.  The measured per-lesson body cost is recorded in the
# night-shift log beside this build; it is not guessed here.
#
# WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND BEING A SENSE: the measured autonomy blocker
# (2026-08-06) was never energy, it was CUE FORMATION — and the approved
# design round was motivation pressure.  A body that cannot feel its own
# hunger has nothing for hunger to be a cue OF.  This is the receptor half of
# that round; no scheduler, no score, no drive variable.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHEMORECEPTION — taste and smell (2026-08-07).
#
# BIOLOGICAL COUNTERPART: gustatory receptors on the intake surface, which
# sense a substance IN CONTACT, and olfactory receptors, which sense the
# volatile fraction of the same substance AT A DISTANCE.  One receptor class,
# two ranges.  They are grown together because they answer the same physical
# question about the same material, and an animal that eats has both.
#
# WHAT THEY SENSE, AND WHY IT IS NOT INVENTED: she already has a feeding
# path, and a caller already authors what she is fed.  A nutrition
# declaration that states its COMPOSITION is exactly the same authority class
# as an approved card's declared surface — authored material, honestly
# labelled as authored, never a chemical measurement of a real substance.
# With NOTHING being eaten every channel carries its true zero, which is a
# lawful state exactly as darkness and silence are.
#
# THE HONEST LIMIT, stated here so no surface has to imply otherwise: she can
# taste and smell WHAT SHE IS GIVEN.  She cannot smell a room, because there
# is no room; that waits for the environment, and this does not pretend to
# be it.
#
# GROWTH RATE, stated before building it: five gustatory sites and eight
# olfactory sites, thirteen substreams per hop and two additional occurrences
# (contact chemoreception and volatile chemoreception are separate physical
# structures and are never folded into one).  The measured per-lesson body
# cost is recorded beside this build, not guessed.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BALANCE AND BODY POSITION — the displacement receptors (2026-08-07).
#
# BIOLOGICAL COUNTERPART: the vestibular apparatus, which senses the motion
# of the head, and proprioceptors, which sense where the body is.  Both
# answer one physical question — HOW DID THIS BODY JUST MOVE — so they are
# one receptor field of four sites: three of translation and one of turning.
#
# WHY THESE COULD NOT BE BUILT UNTIL NOW, stated plainly because it is the
# whole point: a balance receptor with nothing moving is a fabrication.  She
# had no body that moved and nowhere to move it, so every earlier attempt
# would have had to INVENT the motion.  The deterministic world already in
# this repository gives her a real pose in a real place, and moving in it
# produces a real displacement between two real poses.  That displacement is
# what these receptors transduce — never a number chosen by an author.
#
# THE HONEST LIMIT: she feels motion that ACTUALLY HAPPENED to her body in
# that world.  With no world mounted the field is empty and both senses
# report absent, which is the truth.
#
# GROWTH RATE, stated before building: four receptor sites, four substreams
# per hop, ONE additional occurrence (a body moves as one body).  Measured
# cost recorded beside the build.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PLACE SHE IS IN (2026-08-07) — contract item 9, the truthful virtual
# world and embodiment.
#
# The world is not new code.  A deterministic authority for regions, portals,
# bodies, objects, optical surfaces and air already exists in this repository
# (dsf_ai_service/substrate/embodiment_world.py) with passing tests, three
# furnished regions and forty-two objects — and it has been wired to NOTHING.
# So has the receptor layer beside it, which already produces exactly the
# substream type this organism eats.
#
# WHAT MAKES THE BRIDGE HONEST RATHER THAN A GUESS: the world's retina is
# 3 rows by 9 columns — the SAME 27 cells her card surface declares — with
# six spectral bands per cell.  Her retina is monochrome, so the bands are
# averaged into the one luminance per cell she has a receptor for.  Nothing
# is invented; she simply has no colour receptors yet, and that is stated
# rather than hidden.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE ONLY WAY BALANCE AND BODY POSITION CAN BE REAL: a
# displacement receptor needs a displacement, and a displacement needs two
# real poses of a real body in a real place.  Moving her here produces one.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Vocal anatomy is not yet part of the one native organism. A retired Python
# motor owner and sidecar state must not be mounted as a second organism.

    # the VR environment have all 6").  Her world already carried the physics
    # for odour, taste, temperature and the three touch qualities, and every
    # object here was declared with light and nothing else — so a thing she
    # could SEE reached none of her other senses.  These are declarations of
    # what each thing IS, in the world's own units, exactly like reflectance.
    #
    # Odour is eight channels because her olfactory receptors are eight; the
    # world does not name them, so they are used as eight volatile classes:
    #   0 fruit ester · 1 cooked savoury · 2 dairy fat · 3 wood
    #   4 fabric dust · 5 paper ink · 6 warm electronics · 7 soap
    # Taste is her five: sweet, salt, sour, bitter, umami.
    #
    # THE SIXTH SENSE IS NOT HERE AND IS NOT FAKED: her world has no acoustic
    # emission law, so nothing in a room can make a noise yet. Sight, touch,
    # taste, smell and body are real from this point on; sound needs an
    # emission-and-propagation law written the way odour transport already is.

        the part of its geometry that IS declared.
      * POSITION.  The sheet declares no origin, no handedness and no
        preferred direction, so the only placement invariant under its own
        reflection symmetries is CENTRED.  Any offset would be an invented
        number.

    Occupancy is then the exact area of (footprint ∩ site patch) divided by the

    exactly as the living organism was seeded: the two legacy ear sites carry
    no authored contacts and no receptor law governs them, so they can never
    genesis a cohort of their own.

    * THE RETINAL GROUP IS A SHEET, NOT A CHAIN.  Its contacts are the

      24 within-row pairs and 18 within-column pairs, 42 in total.  The retired

    * Each cochlear group chains its 16 tonotopic sites in TONOTOPIC order.
      The chain is anatomy, not convenience: the basilar membrane is one
      continuous mechanical structure, so neighbouring places are coupled, and
      distant places are not.  The two cochleae are NOT chained to each other —
      two ears are two separate structures and no coupling between them is
      declared (no head geometry exists to declare one).
    * The chain is also what makes a structure able to REMEMBER: participation
      retention requires at least three changed members connected through
      contacts that were physically active, and an unchained cohort would
      satisfy the count and fail the connectivity forever.

      (reference irradiance 4, aperture 1, absorptance 1/2, coupling 1).  A
      250 ms hop of the brightest real card site (L ~ 0.85) delivers ~0.43
      zJ, below the +1 zJ plastic support barrier, so the gate free energy
      stays positive, no conformation opens, gate conductance stays zero,
      and no current can cross the 500 pS chain contacts.  The dark card
      sites therefore never change and `admit_physical_mosaic` refuses with
      RecurrenceDidNotChangeEveryMember.
    - Raising the dwell until a gate can open requires 2 * L * T in
      (1, 3.25] zJ AND an exact multiple of the 1/16 zJ dissipation lattice
      (36 quanta capacity).  Real card sites carry distinct 8-bit luminances,
      so on one shared presentation clock at most the sites sharing one exact
      luminance value land on the lattice; any other lit site is refused
      outright (DissipationNotQuantized).  A spatial card region cannot be
      lit above the barrier lawfully.
    - Measured separately: once any gate does open, the injected charge
      never leaves the 27-site chain — 600 dark hops (150 s) after a single
      lattice-aligned flip still showed 3-21 neurons changing per hop and no
      quiescence, so no experience is retained from an electrically active
      presentation either.  The card lessons that do retain an experience
      retain one with zero electrical activity.

    Nothing here is forced: the mode delivers the honest partial cue and the
    observation reports the physics' real answer.

# must be live rather than decorative").
#
# Six controls on the interaction page — offer text, picture, PDF, book,
# audio, song — have been rendered, disabled, and backed by nothing.  They
# are not new senses and they are not a new pathway: a picture is light and a
# song is pressure, so every one of them reduces to a route this organism
# already runs and that is already severing-proven.
#
#   any raster  -> _raster_luminance -> the same 27 retinal sites the
#                  approved cards and the live camera reach
#   any audio   -> pcm_s16le mono 16 kHz -> the same cochlear decomposition
#                  the tutor voice and the microphone reach
#   any page    -> one raster per page, presented in order
#
# NOTHING SEMANTIC ENTERS.  The text a person types is rendered to pixels in
# their own browser and only the PIXELS are offered; the string is never
# submitted.  A PDF is light, not words.  This is the contract's own rule
# (item 11: external-world experiences "may not insert meanings, memories,
# answers, or semantic labels into cognition").

#                      container (verified).  A book becomes PAGES OF LIGHT

#                      text, title, author or meaning enters cognition —
#                      contract item 11 — because to an organism that has
